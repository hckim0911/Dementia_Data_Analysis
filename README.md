## Dementia High-Risk Group Prediction Project

## Purpose

* To verify the feasibility of using sleep and gait data for proactive monitoring and identification of dementia high-risk groups

## Exploratory Questions

* Can sleep and gait data be used to identify dementia high-risk groups?
* Which sleep and gait data are most effective for monitoring and identifying dementia high-risk groups?
* How accurately can dementia high-risk groups be identified based on these specific sleep and gait data?

* Project main contents, scope, etc.
* **Main Contents and Scope:**
    * Verify whether sleep and gait data can be used to identify dementia high-risk groups early.
    * Explore the optimal combination of data to identify dementia high-risk groups early.
    * Develop an AI model that can accurately predict dementia high-risk groups based on the optimal data combination.
